Implementation of Dual Clock Asynchronous FIFO   ◦ Designed an Asynchronous FIFO in Verilog, synthesised &amp; functionally verified in Xilinx Vivado. ◦ Utilized Gray Code for robust FIFO pointer synchronization to avoid multi-bit transitions. ◦ Implemented a reliable 2 Flip-Flop Synchronizer to effectively mitigate meta-stability in CDC.
